# Formula1-Analysis-Using-Azure-Databricks
## Project Overview:
Real World Project on Formula1 Racing using Azure Databricks, Delta Lake and orchestrated by Azure Data Factory.
This project aims to provide a data analysis solution for Formula-1 race results using Azure Databricks. 
This is an ETL pipeline to ingest Formula 1 motor racing data, transform and load it into our data warehouse for reporting 
and analysis purposes. The data is sourced from ergast.com, a website dedicated to Formula 1 statistics, and is stored in Azure Datalake Gen2 storage. 
Data transformation and analysis were performed using Azure Databricks. The entire process is orchestrated using Azure Data Factory.
